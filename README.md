- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Analysis
- Basic dataset information
- Summary statistics
- Visualization of distributions
- Pairplots and correlation analysis

## Conclusion
The EDA reveals insights into the relationships between different features of iris flowers, aiding further analysis and modeling.
